 The ancient game of Qirkat (more commonly known by its Spanish name, Alquerque) is a forebear of checkers (draughts) and numerous other games throughout the world. It appears to be of middle-eastern origin, and to have been introduced into Europe by Moorish invaders. You can find more information in [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque).
